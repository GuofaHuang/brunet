PURPOSE
==========
The Brunet.Messaging module provides a basic model for datagram style
messaging, and services which can be build on top of such a model.  There is
nothing specific to P2P protocols here, but only communication tools that make
building systems easier.

MODULE DEPENDENCIES
==========
This code depends on:
Brunet.Collections
Brunet.Concurrent
Brunet.Util

TODO
==========
This module currently depends on Node, which depends on almost everything.  In
order to improve modularization, that should be fixed.  The path I suggest is
to remove the Node dependency in ReqrepManager and RpcManager.  Also,
SenderFactory should not take a Node and a string to create a sender, it
should probably take an object and sender.  The object can represent the
"context" that the sender is being created in.  When the Node creates a
sender, it can do so with itself as the context.
