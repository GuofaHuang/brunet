Here's how to build IPOP

First you have probably already done:

hg clone <url to brunet> brunet-dev
hg clone <url to ipop> ipop
cd ipop

if you put your brunet source somewhere other than ../brunet-dev change
the property in ipop.build.

nant
cd src/ipop/build
<the following as root>
tunctl
mono IPRouter.exe ipop.config >> output.txt &
dhclient tap0
