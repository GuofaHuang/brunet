SocialVPN

Building SocialVPN
==================
NAnt build tool is required

For debian-based systems:
apt-get install nant

For RedHat-based systems:
yum install nant

cd src/

To compile, run:

nant

To run NUnit test, run:

nant test

To clean, run

nant clean

Dependencies:
=============
SocialVPN is built on top of two other projects:
1) The Brunet P2P Library 
   - http://github.com/johnynek/brunet/tree/master (based repo)
   - http://github.com/davidiw/brunet/tree/master (added features)
2) The IP over P2P Application (IPOP)
   - http://github.com/davidiw/ipop/tree/master

All packaged binaries found under lib and bin directories are compiled from
these two projects.

Troubleshooting:
================
The libtuntap.so and libtuntap.dll files are platform-dependent, they have to
be compiled for your platform. Platform specific binaries can be found at
socialvpn.org.
