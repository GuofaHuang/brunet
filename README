Running SocialVPN
=================
After compiling, all files to run SocialVPN are saved in bin directory.
Hence, You can move bin directory anywhere that you want without worrying
about dependencies.

Go inside of bin directory (cd)

For Windows XP, run the start_win.cmd file

For Windows Vista, right-click on start_win.cmd and "Run as administrator"

For Linux, see instructions below to run as normal user (much safer)

chmod 666 /dev/net/tun/

tunctl -u "your username" -t tapipop

To find your username run the whoami command

Then run the start_linux.sh

Accessing SocialVPN Web Interface
=================================
SocialVPN can be managed through a Web browser or the wget command line
utility. The start_win.cmd and the start_win.sh files contains the port
number used to access the interface. The default port number is 58888.

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:58888/


Dependencies:
=============
SocialVPN is built on top of two other projects:
1) The Brunet P2P Library 
   - http://github.com/johnynek/brunet/tree/master (based repo)
   - http://github.com/davidiw/brunet/tree/master (added features)
2) The IP over P2P Application (IPOP)
   - http://github.com/davidiw/ipop/tree/master

All packaged binaries found under lib and bin directories are compiled from
these two projects.

Troubleshooting:
================
The libtuntap.so and libtuntap.dll files are platform-dependent, they have to
be compiled for your platform. Platform specific binaries can be found at
socialvpn.org.
